Sticky Notes is an activity for creating a post-it wall for brainstormings, ranking...

# Features ##

On install, admin can choose 6 colors which will be used throughall activities in Moodle. Default colors
have been chosen to respect accessibility and colorblindness.

Adding a Sticky Notes activity is like adding any other activity in Moodle. Turn on editing mode and
add activity "Sticky Notes".

When using the activity, users can create, update and delete their own notes in different columns
(columns can only be created by teachers).

It gives possibility to "like" notes just by cliking a little heart icon.

When creating an activity, teacher can define several features or limitation :
- capability to create a note with different background color
- choose colors to use in activity between the 6 default colors
- add a meaning for every color
- limit the number of notes a user can create 
- limit the number of votes a user can do
- enable the rotate effect.

This activity is anonymous for student : no names appears. But teachers can choose to viewing creator names
for thier own use.
